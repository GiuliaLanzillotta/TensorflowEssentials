# Tensorflow essentials
A trip through the essentials of Tensorflow. 
Much of what I know comes from the amazing book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow**. 
The idea is to go from Tensorflow 1.x to Tensorflow 2.x, while exposing some essential concepts in Tensorflow development. 

## 1. Building a DNN from scratch
> Yeah, this notebook is not as exciting as launching a rocket into space or discussing about quantum physics.
What I would like to show though is the level of detail and attention that one needs to put into building even the simpler version of such powerful models. In a nutshell, the message here is to be responsible even when the task seems fairly easy.

## 2. Distributed computation 
> Tensorflow offers the user different ditributed computation tools. In the notebook I explore the parallelization of simple graphs across several GPUs on a single machine. On the other hand parallelizing across multiple servers using Tensorflow can be really hard. Other frameworks such as Apache MXnet offer fairly easy tools to parallelize the computation over clusters of machines.
