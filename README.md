# Tensorflow essentials
A trip through the essentials of Tensorflow. 
Much of what I know comes from the amazing book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow**. 

## 1. Building a DNN from scratch
> Yeah, this notebook is not as exciting as launching a rocket into space or discussing about quantum physics.
What I would like to show though is the level of detail and attention that one needs to put into building even the simpler version of such powerful models. In a nutshell, the message here is to be responsible even when the task seems fairly easy.
